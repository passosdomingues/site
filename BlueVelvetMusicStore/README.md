# Term assignment: Full-stack web application for managing product categories in the Bluevelvet Music Store.

A front-end web application for managing product categories in the BlueVelvet Music Store, built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This frontend may be used as a starting point for the term assignment for the Application Lifecycle Management course, taught by Rodrigo Martins Pagliares at the undergraduate Computer Science course at UNIFAL-MG - Alfenas - MG - Brazil.

You can try this frontend web application without a backend application and a database server. The frontend in this repository is self-contained and can be used to perform simple CRUD operations on a categories table upon logging in. The data is stored and retrieved from LocalStorage. New users can register themselves.

## What the students neeed to do in this assignment?

- Implement a full stack web application for product categories (CRUD) for the administrator module of BlueVelvet Music Store
- The backend must be implemented using Spring Boot
- You can choose the technologies used for the frontend: (i) use the frontend described in this repository (vanilla HTML, CSS e Javacript communication with a RESTful API in the backend, (ii) Using a template engine like Thymeleaf to generate the views for the frontend (strategy used in the videos by Prof. Fellipe Rey), and (iii) Using a JavaScript library like React for the frontend communicating with the backend using valilla JavaScript and/or some library for asynchronous communication with the backend (e.g, axios)

## Technologies I suggest you use in this assignment 

These are the **backend** technologies I suggest you use when developing your solution:   
- Spring Boot
- MySQL or an embedded (in memory) database
- Thymeleaf + HTML + CSS + Javascript (if you decide to use a template engine with for dynamic generation of web page on the server) 
- Traditional MVC or REST controller when using a template engine such as Thymeleaf or REST controller for a decoupled frontend (see frontend technologies below). 

These are the **frontend** technologies I suggest you if you decide to **not use a template engine such as Thymeleaf**   
- HTML
- Vanilla CSS (without CSS libraries such as BootStrap pr TailWind)
- Vanilla JavaScript (without libraries\frameworks such as vue or React)
- JavaScript/CCS Libraries (bootstrap, React, etc)

## Definition of DONE (Scrum)

The user stories are considered completed if:
- They meet the acceptance criteria;
- They "crosses" all layers within the application (web user interface, controller, service, repository, resource/database)
- They are decoupled from backend 
- The view layer must fully responsive (responsive layout).

# Tips

This assignment complements the one used in the Web Programming course. Check its <a href="https://github.com/pagliares/product-management-bluevelvet-music-store" target="_blank"> repository</a> to get some ideas for this assignment. Note that the Web Programming repository includes a frontend example that simulates CRUD operations on products of the BlueVelvet Music Store without a backend implementation, using the JavaScript LocalStorage API to simulate persistence.
